BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0 (BBCSDL) is an entirely free and Open Source
cross-platform implementation of BBC BASIC for Windows, MacOS,
Linux (x86 CPU only), Raspberry Pi OS (RPi3 or later), Android,
iOS or for running in a browser.
It combines the simplicity of BASIC with the sophistication of a
structured language, allowing you to write utilities and games,
use sound and graphics, and perform calculations.
The Desktop editions (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi)
include a BASIC program editor with syntax colouring, live
indentation, search & replace and many other features.
Built-in diagnostic aids such as run-time trace, listing of
variables, single-step execution and a profiler make debugging
even the most complex programs straightforward.
