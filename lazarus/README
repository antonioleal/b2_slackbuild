lazarus (rapid application development tool for freepascal)

Lazarus is a Rapid Application Development Tool for FreePascal. It
comes with the LCL - Lazarus Component Library, which contains platform
independent visual components like buttons, windows, checkbox, treeview
and many, many more. The LCL is platform independent, so you can write
an application once and then compile for various platforms without
changing code.

This package builds lazarus with "gtk2".
You can build lazarus with "qt5" by following these steps:

1. install the package libqtpas available at SlackBuilds.org
2. modify the lazarus.SlackBuild file line
        LCL=${LCL:-gtk2}
   to
        LCL=${LCL:-qt5}
3. build lazarus with this modified slackbuild

Note: before installing lazarus 3.0 make sure first to remove any
previous lazarus installation, then upgrading fpc to version 3.2.2
build 3 as the fpc sources are now included in fpc package.
