lazarus (rapid application development tool for freepascal)

Lazarus is a Rapid Application Development Tool for FreePascal. It
comes with the LCL - Lazarus Component Library, which contains platform
independent visual components like buttons, windows, checkbox, treeview
and many, many more. The LCL is platform independent, so you can write
an application once and then compile for various platforms without
changing code.

Note: before installing lazarus 3.0 make sure to remove any previous
lazarus installation and first upgrading the free pascal compile to
version 3.2.2 build 3 as the fpc-sources are now included in this
build.
