CanAce is a fork by Lawrence Woodman of xAce featuring a
tcl frontend and some fixes to the original source.

It is an emulator for the Jupiter Ace that runs under most
flavours of Unix. It was originally written by Edward Patel and
based on a ZX81 emulator called xz81 written by Russell Marks,
which was in turn based on Ian Collier's xz80, a ZX Spectrum
emulator for X.
